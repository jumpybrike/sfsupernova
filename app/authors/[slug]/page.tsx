// Detailed biographies
const authorBiographies: { [key: string]: string } = {
  'h-g-wells': `Herbert George Wells (1866-1946) was an English author who pioneered science fiction as we know it today. Often called "the father of science fiction," Wells wrote classics that defined entire sub-genres: alien invasion (The War of the Worlds), time travel (The Time Machine), and mad science (The Island of Doctor Moreau).

Born in Bromley, Kent, to a working-class family, Wells won a scholarship to study biology under Thomas Henry Huxley. This scientific education profoundly influenced his writing, grounding fantastical concepts in scientific plausibility—what would later be called "hard science fiction."

Wells' early novels (1895-1901) remain his most influential. The Time Machine (1895) invented the time travel genre. The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896) explored bioethics decades before the term existed. The Invisible Man (1897) examined how power without accountability corrupts. The War of the Worlds (1898) created the alien invasion template still used today. The First Men in the Moon (1901) imagined space travel with remarkable prescience.

Unlike his contemporary Jules Verne, who emphasized technological possibility, Wells focused on social commentary. His stories used fantastic scenarios to critique Victorian society, imperialism, and class division. The Time Machine's Eloi and Morlocks represent his socialist concerns about class evolution. The War of the Worlds reversed colonial invasion, with humans experiencing what Britain inflicted on others.

Later in life, Wells turned to social and political writing, producing non-fiction about world government and education. His fiction output declined, but his early works secured his legacy as science fiction's founding father.

Wells' influence is immeasurable. Nearly every major sci-fi trope can be traced to his novels. Writers from Isaac Asimov to Margaret Atwood cite him as an inspiration. His works remain perpetually in print, having never fallen out of favor in over 125 years.`,

  'jules-verne': `Jules Gabriel Verne (1828-1905) was a French novelist who pioneered the genre of science fiction, often called scientific romance in his era. His meticulous research and boundless imagination produced some of literature's most enduring adventures.

Born in Nantes, France, Verne was sent to Paris to study law, but his passion for writing led him to abandon his legal career. He met publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who would publish all of Verne's major works and encourage his combination of adventure and scientific accuracy.

Verne's works were characterized by extensive research. Before writing about submarines in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, he studied naval engineering. His predictions were remarkably prescient: he imagined space travel (From the Earth to the Moon), electric submarines (Twenty Thousand Leagues), and global communication networks.

Unlike H.G. Wells, who used fantastic scenarios for social commentary, Verne focused on technological possibility and adventure. His heroes were explorers, engineers, and scientists pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. Captain Nemo remains one of literature's great mysterious geniuses.

Verne's influence extended beyond literature. His books inspired real-world explorers and inventors. Simon Lake, who built early submarines, said Verne inspired his career. The Apollo 11 astronauts acknowledged Verne's influence on their mission.

During his lifetime, Verne was France's best-selling author. He wrote over 60 novels in his "Voyages Extraordinaires" series, each combining exotic locations with scientific speculation. His works have never gone out of print and have been translated into over 140 languages.`,

  'edgar-rice-burroughs': `Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was an American writer who created the planetary romance genre and became one of the most influential pulp authors. While best known for Tarzan, his science fiction works—particularly the Barsoom (Mars) and Pellucidar series—defined adventure science fiction.

Born in Chicago, Burroughs had an unsuccessful early career, trying and failing at various jobs including pencil sharpener wholesaling. At age 35, broke and desperate, he began writing pulp fiction. His first novel, A Princess of Mars, introduced John Carter and the dying world of Barsoom. It was an immediate success.

Burroughs' Mars novels created the planetary romance template: a Earth man transported to an exotic world, strange civilizations, beautiful princesses, sword fights, and wild adventures. The science was absurd (Carter "wills" himself to Mars), but the storytelling was irresistible. His influence on later science fiction is immense—Star Wars, Avatar, and countless others owe him a debt.

Unlike the "hard science fiction" of later writers like Asimov and Clarke, Burroughs wrote what would be called "soft" or "adventure" science fiction. Scientific accuracy mattered less than exotic settings and thrilling action. His hollow earth series (Pellucidar) and Venus novels continued this approach.

Burroughs was also a savvy businessman. He founded his own publishing company and was one of the first authors to incorporate himself. The town of Tarzana, California is named after his Tarzan character—he owned the land.

His prose was often criticized as purple and his science as nonsense, but his imagination and storytelling kept readers enthralled. Modern science fiction writers from Ray Bradbury to Michael Moorcock have cited him as a major influence. He proved that science fiction could be wildly popular.`,

  'mary-shelley': `Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (1797-1851) was an English novelist who, at age 18, wrote what is widely considered the first science fiction novel: Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Her exploration of scientific responsibility, the nature of humanity, and the consequences of playing God remains profoundly relevant 200+ years later.

Born to two revolutionary thinkers—feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft and political philosopher William Godwin—Shelley grew up in an intellectually radical household. Her mother died shortly after her birth, but Mary was educated in her mother's feminist principles.

At 16, she eloped with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (already married). The summer of 1816, Mary and Percy were staying with Lord Byron near Geneva. During a period of bad weather, Byron proposed they each write a ghost story. Mary conceived Frankenstein during this "year without a summer."

Frankenstein was published anonymously in 1818 (with a preface by Percy, leading many to assume he wrote it). The novel is notable for its scientific rather than supernatural premise: Victor Frankenstein uses chemistry and biology to create life. This grounding in science, rather than magic, makes it the first true science fiction novel.

The novel explores themes that would become central to science fiction: the responsibility of the creator for their creation, the danger of unchecked scientific ambition, the meaning of humanity, and the consequences of isolation. The monster is not evil by nature but made so by society's rejection—a sophisticated exploration of nature versus nurture.

Shelley wrote other novels but none achieved Frankenstein's impact. She spent much of her later life editing and promoting her late husband's works (Percy drowned in 1822). Modern feminist scholars have rediscovered her other writings and her important place in literary history.

Frankenstein has never been out of print. It has inspired countless adaptations and remains a touchstone for discussions about scientific ethics, artificial intelligence, and what it means to be human.`,

  'isaac-asimov': `Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was an American writer and biochemistry professor, one of the most prolific authors of all time with over 500 books published. Along with Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he formed the "Big Three" of Golden Age science fiction.

Born in Russia, Asimov immigrated to the United States at age three. He grew up in Brooklyn, where his parents owned a candy store that sold science fiction magazines. These pulps sparked his imagination and writing ambition.

Asimov's Foundation series, inspired by Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, imagined a future galactic empire and the science of psychohistory—using mathematics to predict societal trends. The series won a special Hugo Award as the "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.

His Robot stories established the Three Laws of Robotics, a framework for thinking about artificial intelligence that has influenced both fiction and real robotics research. The laws seem simple but Asimov explored their complex implications in dozens of stories.

Unlike many science fiction writers who focused on space opera or adventure, Asimov emphasized ideas and logic puzzles. His stories often featured scientists solving problems through reason rather than action. This made science fiction intellectually respectable.

Asimov had a PhD in biochemistry and taught at Boston University. His science writing made complex topics accessible to general readers. He wrote popular science books on nearly every scientific subject, plus mysteries, history, Shakespeare, and the Bible.

His influence on science fiction is incalculable. Concepts like positronic brains, psychohistory, and the Three Laws of Robotics have become part of the genre's vocabulary. Modern writers like Greg Bear and Greg Egan follow his tradition of idea-driven hard science fiction.`,
